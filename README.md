# Data structures by Stefan ( Destroyergm )
Welcome to my project on ruby data structures. I'm doing this with The Odin project and the exersises from Computer Science section. You can take a look at that section here: [Odin Project - CS](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms)

For convinience all 3 student projects from that page are collected in this repository.
I've also added some of my own sorting alghotritams, that were not part of the exersise.

# Recursion
Recursion file contains a function to calculate the fib value of the given number.

# Sorting
Sorting contains some sorting alghoritams that I've implemented and they include:
 - [x] Buble Sort
 - [x] Merge Sort
 - [ ] Quick Sort 
 - [ ] Insersion Sort
 - [ ] Selection Sort

# Binarry Trees
The sub-folder trees contains the ruby files that make up the Binary search tree.

# Graph
The folder knight contains all the code for the "Knight's tour" challange from the website.

# About
Thanks for viewing this repository. :)

I've made all this thanks to the great material suplied by the odin project.
